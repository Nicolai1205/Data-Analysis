Create a simple SELECT query to display student information of all ACTIVE students.

TABLE STRUCTURE:

students
Id	FirstName	LastName	IsActive

Note: IsActive (true or false)


--My Solution--

SELECT
  id,
  FirstName,
  LastName,
  IsActive
FROM
  students
WHERE
  IsActive 


--Explanation--

You do not need to set IsActive to True as by saying Where IsActive, it is already only validating and
thus showing you True values.
