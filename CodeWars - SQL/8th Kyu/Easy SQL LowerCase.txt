Given a demographics table in the following format:

** demographics table schema **

id
name
birthday
race
you need to return the same table where all letters are lowercase in the race column.


--My solution--

SELECT
  id,
  name,
  birthday,
  LOWER(race) as race
FROM
  demographics;


--Explanation--

Lower converts all letters in a string to lower case.
