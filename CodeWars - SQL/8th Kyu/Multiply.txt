This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

--Initial code--

SELECT price + amount AS total FROM items

--It does not return the expected result. The task is to multiply the two columns, not simply add them together.

--My Solution--

SELECT price * amount AS total FROM items -- Just change the + to a * to multiply the two columns
