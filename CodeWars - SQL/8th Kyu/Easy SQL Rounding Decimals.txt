Given the following table 'decimals':

** decimals table schema **

id
number1
number2
Return a table with two columns (number1, number2), 
the value in number1 should be rounded down and the value in number2 should be rounded up.


--My Solution--

SELECT
  FLOOR(number1) as number1,
  CEILING(number2) as number2
FROM
  decimals;


--Explanation--

ROUND ended up rounding up wrong numbers, possible due to needed decimals values greater than 5 to round up.
Ceiling does not need decimal values.
